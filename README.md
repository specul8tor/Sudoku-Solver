# **Sudoku Solver**
## *By, Azaan Azam*

First complex coding project that I started in Summer 2019.
Made using Python with Pygame.

Programmed an algorithm that can solve any sudoku board using the backtracking algorithm (very poorly
done considering its my first ever coding project). Also created a GUI using Pygame to show the algorithm
in working in real time. Included options to either use a hard coded board or key in your own board using "1"
or "2" as navigation buttons for both implementations. For GUI version, you need to press spacebar for the
backtracking algorithm to kick in.

### **COMMANDS**

1. Go into directory (activate virtual environment if you want)
2. 'python SudokuSolver.py' if you want the command line version
3. 'python SudokuSolver.py' if you want the GUI verion

### **Stability**

As of Febuary 1, 2021, both versions are working fine regardless of whether your are using the default board
or entering your own. Code was very messy since it was my first time so will probably not go edit it anytime
soon.
